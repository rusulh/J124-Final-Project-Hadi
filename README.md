<h1> J 124 Final Project: Pregnancies, Births and Abortions in the United States, 1973â€“2017

<h2> By Rusul Hadi</h2>
<h2> Story Summary </h2>

In summary, my data is from The Guttmacher Institute which compiles comprehensive historical data on pregnancy, childbirth, and abortion rates among individuals of reproductive age in the United States. The latest report presents national statistics spanning from 1973 to 2017, the latest year with comparable data. Additionally, state-level statistics are accessible for specific years ranging from 1988 to 2017. Within this report, I emphasize several trends found in these updated demographic and provide interactive visuals for in-depth data investigation. Furthermore, an accompanying appendix details the methodology and sources employed in this analysis.

Recording the rates of pregnancy, childbirth, and abortion across various time periods and age categories serves to provide a comprehensive depiction of the shifts in individuals' reproductive experiences over the last four decades
