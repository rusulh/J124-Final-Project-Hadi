## Data Analysis Process
I initiated my analysis by performing data cleaning as the initial step. Upon examination, the data displayed a predominantly normalized state, necessitating minimal refinement.
Scope of analysis: in the context of a dataset pertains to the specific boundaries and parameters that outline the extent and focus of the study conducted on the dataset

1. Which age group experienced the highest and lowest pregnancy rates during the observed period?
2. How have pregnancy rates varied among different age groups of women over the years?
3. Is there a noticeable trend in teenage pregnancy rates from 1973 to 2017?
4. Which state had the highest overall birth rate in 2017, and which had the lowest?
5. Which age group had the highest birth rate nationally in 2017, and which had the lowest?

### Key Assumptions
* All questions were addressed solely using the provided dataset.
* The dataset covers a significant number of years to capture meaningful trends. The data for each age group is complete and representative. 
* Birth rates are calculated uniformly and consistently across all states. The dataset includes accurate and comprehensive birth rate data for all states in 2017.
* Birth rates are calculated using the same methodology for all age groups. The dataset provides accurate and complete birth rate data for all age groups in 2017. 

### Analysis
