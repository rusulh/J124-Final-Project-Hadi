<h1> J 124 Final Project: Pregnancies, Births and Abortions in the United States, 1973â€“2017

<h2> By Rusul Hadi</h2>
<h2> Story Summary; Decades of Choice </h2>

In summary, my analysis of the data reveals that over the past twenty-five years, pregnancy rates have experienced a decline among women aged 24 or younger, whereas there has been an upward trend in rates for those above the age of 30. These observed patterns highlight distinct shifts in birth and abortion rates: The decrease in pregnancy rates among younger individuals can be attributed to reductions in both birth and abortion rates. In contrast, abortion rates among older age-groups have remained relatively steady as birth rates have shown an increase. On a broader scale, the trends at the state level largely align with national trends over time. However, notable geographic variations emerge: In 2017, pregnancy rates were notably higher among younger individuals in the South and Southwest regions, compared to other areas. Conversely, the Northwest and Northeast exhibited elevated pregnancy rates among older age-groups.

<h2>Sourcing</h2>
I conducted an examination of the "Pregnancies, Births and Abortions Rates in the United States" dataset, which was obtained from the Guttmacher Institute. The crux of my investigation pertains to the statistical counts of pregnancies including births, abortions, and fetal losses from 1973 to 2017.

### Interview Contacts
1) Isaac Maddow-Zimet, The Guttmacher Institute 
	* Email: imaddowzimet@guttmacher.org
	* Phone Number: (212)248-1111 
	* Isaac Maddow-Zimet became a part of the Guttmacher Institute in 2010, and he has held his present role since 2017. His primary research focuses on topics such as unintended pregnancy, adolescent sexual health and conduct, American sex education, and the issue of unsafe abortion in nations where abortion is prohibited or significantly regulated. I want to interview him and ask to further questions regarding the abortion rates in the United States and what are the causes of the high rates. 
2) Kathryn Kost, The Guttmacher Institute
	* Email: kkost@guttmacher.org
	* Phone Number: (212)248-1111
	* Within the Guttmacher Institute, Dr. Kost's research encompasses a variety of subjects essential for comprehending reproductive behaviors and patterns within the United States. This includes examining sexual behavior trends, profiling abortion patients, investigating the health impacts of unintended pregnancies, and providing estimations related to contraceptive effectiveness. I want to ask how she investigates the health impacts and how she is able to prove estimations.

## Data Analysis Process
I initiated my analysis by performing data cleaning as the initial step. Upon examination, the data displayed a predominantly normalized state, necessitating minimal refinement.
Scope of analysis: in the context of a dataset pertains to the specific boundaries and parameters that outline the extent and focus of the study conducted on the dataset

1. Which age group experienced the highest and lowest pregnancy rates during the observed period?
2. How have pregnancy rates varied among different age groups of women over the years?
3. Is there a noticeable trend in teenage pregnancy rates from 1973 to 2017?
4. Which state had the highest overall birth rate in 2017, and which had the lowest?
5. Which age group had the highest birth rate nationally in 2017, and which had the lowest?

### Key Assumptions
* All questions were addressed solely using the provided dataset.
* The dataset covers a significant number of years to capture meaningful trends. The data for each age group is complete and representative. 
* Birth rates are calculated uniformly and consistently across all states. The dataset includes accurate and comprehensive birth rate data for all states in 2017.
* Birth rates are calculated using the same methodology for all age groups. The dataset provides accurate and complete birth rate data for all age groups in 2017. 

### Analysis
1. Which age group experienced the highest and lowest pregnancy rates during the observed period?
